A family owned business that has set the standard in beautiful fresh trees and service. </p>

                    <p className="pb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">In 2014, my journey with Olympic Christmas Trees began. I was looking for a seasonal job and fortunately I noticed an advertisement on Craigslist for help needed on a Christmas tree lot. I inquired, spoke with Dan, the owner, and he said to me: "Meet me at the lot for a day and let's see how it works out." All I wanted to do was work hard, be reliable, take on any task and give my all to Dan and our customers. I was so grateful to him for hiring me and for the opportunity. I wanted to make sure I provided the same all around service the family offered every customer.  I quickly started learning as much as possible about the different trees, where the trees are farmed, about the family business and how the business started. </p>

                    <p className="pb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">After one season with Olympic Christmas Trees, I was hooked! Every season since, I look forward to getting back on the lot to represent the family, to reconnect and interact with our customers and assist them in choosing a fresh tree for their Christmas celebration year after year. I have worked closely with Dan and Andrew, managing the tree lot for the past 6 years.</p> 

                    <p className="pb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">Starting this season, 2020, I am the new owner of Olympic Christmas Trees CA in Rancho Cucamonga. My family and I couldn't be more thrilled! Although Dan and Andrew will be missed, Olympic Christmas Trees CA will be here to uphold the same values, service and premium trees from the same family farms in Washington State you have grown fond of since day one. </p>

                    <p className="pb-8 text-lg leading-relaxed">My family and I are looking forward to seeing you this season and we are excited for the years ahead.</p>
